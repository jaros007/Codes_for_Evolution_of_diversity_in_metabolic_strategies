# Codes_for_Evolution_of_diversity_in_metabolic_strategies
Fortran codes for individual-population-based simulations of evolution of metabolic strategies. 
Moderatly commented code that runs an hour or less for almost all relevant scenarios. Generate a rand.dat file with 
a seed for random number generator, which should be a negative integer number, e.g. -23452345. Or uncomment the definition of 
seed inside the code.
